title: Blogs I love
---

Visting a well maintained garden is a pleasure. Since blogs are the gardens of the internet, here are some of my favorite gardens to visit.

[Bartosz Ciechanowski](https://ciechanow.ski/) - One of the best interactive visualisations on the internet. I would highly recommend checking out his work on [cameras](https://ciechanow.ski/cameras-and-lenses/).

[Wait but why](https://waitbutwhy.com/) - Tim Urban's blog. His posts are worth every second you spend on them. I would recommend starting with his post on [The Tail End](https://waitbutwhy.com/2015/12/the-tail-end.html). This post will make you think about how you spend your time in terms of events and not years.

[Nicky Case](https://ncase.me/) - Should you just forgive people who make mistakes or punish them? What is the optimal way? As a big fan of game theory, I always found it difficult to explain the concepts to others until I found this gem [The Game of Trust](https://ncase.me/trust/). If there is only-one way to explain game theory, this is it.
