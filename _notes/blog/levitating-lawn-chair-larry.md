Imagine being a pilot, flying at an altitude of 4,900m. You spot a lawn-chair, flying in the sky using 45 weather balloons attached. On the chair is a man wearing sunglasses, with a bottle of soda and a sandwich. This is Larry Walters. 

When Larry was 13 years old, he had a dream. A dream to fly, and on July 8, 1982, he flew. He flew way high and survived (thanks to his planning and some luck) to tell the tale.

For the complete story, I would highly recommend watching this work of art by [Jon Bois](https://www.youtube.com/@jonbois "Jon's youtube").

## Some amusing bits from the incident:

### Larry drops his sunglasses due to the high acceleration.

>**Larry** :
>  
> OK, evidently I lost my glasses.
>
> **Carol**: 
>          
> Larry, come down! You gotta come down if you can't see! Come on down! 
>          
>**Larry** : 
>          
> I've got my other glasses. I can see perfectly don't worry.
>          
> **Carol**: 
>          
> We got your glasses and they're OK. Nothing's wrong with your glasses down here. Over.
>          
>**Larry (some thousand meters in the sky)**: 
>          
> Well, that's good news.

### Aftermath

After his safe descent. The authorities tried to fine him and this was their response:
>"We know he broke some part of the Federal Aviation Act, and as soon as we decide which part it is, some type of charge will be filed. If he had a pilot's license, we'd suspend that, but he doesn't."



That is all for today.
